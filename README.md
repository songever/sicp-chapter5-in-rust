# sicp-chapter5-in-rust

This project is a Rust implementation of the concepts described in Chapter 5 of the "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP). The initial focus is on building the register-machine simulator from section 5.2.

## About This Project

The primary goal of this repository is to work through the concepts of SICP Chapter 5, using Rust as the implementation language. This serves as a learning exercise to better understand both the low-level machine design concepts from SICP and the systems programming capabilities of Rust.

## Current Status

The project has just been initialized. The focus is currently on implementing the register-machine simulator as described in SICP.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Rust toolchain installed. You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
